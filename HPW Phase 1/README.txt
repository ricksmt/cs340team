This is the Phase 1 project for group Awesome, consisting of:
Brian Porter
Jared Wilson
Thomas Hutchins
Todd Brunner
Krista Purser

We ran it using Exp.java and it passed all test cases.
None of the current files are attributed to Todd because his computer died unexpectedly and at the last minute. He came to all our meetings, did the work assigned him, and helped the rest of us with our files so we feel he still deserves full credit. Please contact us if there are any questions
